## ✨ What is this?

A hub where I release my **6DOF head-tracking mods and the NEW true Stereo3D per game mods** — they let you lean, peek, and look around in-game
using your real head movement full ( X, Y , Z axis) positional tracking and full (Yaw , Pitch , Roll ) rotational tracking. Each mod is built on the head-tracking **framework by [Loop](https://github.com/itsloopyo?tab=repositories)**, and provides Stereo3D built into one mod based on x-axis offsets ,
and ships **ready to go**: the mod is already packed with an **ASI loader**, so there's nothing extra to install.

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
> [!TIP]
> 🔧 If `dinput8.dll` doesn't work and tracking dosent start that means the injector failed to hook to game , rename it to one of these. Try them in order — top ones work in almost any game.

| Try | Rename `dinput8.dll` to | Works with |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1️⃣ | `version.dll` · `winmm.dll` | 🌐 Almost any game |
| 2️⃣ | `dxgi.dll` · `d3d11.dll` · `d3d12.dll` | 🎮 DX10/11/12 games |
| 3️⃣ | `d3d9.dll` | 🕹️ Older DX9 games |
| 4️⃣ | `xinput1_3.dll` · `wininet.dll` · `winhttp.dll` · `bink2w64.dll` | ❓ Only sometimes |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 📄 **No `HeadTracking.log`?** The DLL isn't loading — move to the next name. Make sure it's next to the game's `.exe` and no other mod (ReShade, ENB) is using that same name.

## 📥 Install

1. **Download** the mod for your game from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. **Unzip** it.
3. **Copy everything** into your game's folder — the one with the game's `.exe`.
   *(Steam: right-click the game → Manage → Browse local files.)*
4. **Done.** The ASI loader is already included, so the mod loads automatically when the game starts.

> 💡 If nothing happens in-game, run the game **as Administrator** once, or make sure you copied the files
> next to the **right** `.exe` (some games have a launcher exe in a different folder).

---

## 🕹️ Set up head-tracking (OpenTrack)

These mods receive head pose over **UDP** from [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack).

1. Install **OpenTrack** and set up your tracker (webcam, IR, phone app, etc.).
2. In OpenTrack, set **Output** to **`UDP over network`**.
3. Set the destination to **`127.0.0.1`**, port **`4242`**.
4. Hit **Start** in OpenTrack, then launch your game.

## 🥽 Play in VR — Osiris VR Viewer

Want to play these mods in a headset? **[Osiris VR Viewer](https://github.com/BerZerker96/Osiris-Vr-Viewer/tree/main)**
has **Built-In Support** for these mods no need for Opentrack — it brings the head-tracked game into VR so you can look around
naturally in 3D.

👉 Grab it here: **[Osiris VR Viewer](https://github.com/BerZerker96/Osiris-Vr-Viewer/tree/main)**

---

## ⚙️ Configure

Each mod includes a **`HeadTracking.ini`** next to the game's `.exe`. Open it in any text editor to tweak:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `UDPPort` | Must match OpenTrack's port (default **4242**) |
| Sensitivity / multipliers | How far the view moves per head movement |
| Limits | Maximum look angle / lean distance |
| Invert options | Flip an axis if it feels backwards |
| Static FOV *(where supported)* | Pin or widen the field of view |

> 🎮 **In-game hotkeys** (typical): toggle tracking on/off, and **recenter** to your current head position.
> The exact keys are listed in each mod's own README.
